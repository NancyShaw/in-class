# About me
## Nancy Shaw
I am a professional software developer with 9+ years of exeperience. Among other things, I have extensive experience with:
* Java
* MySQL
* REST and SOAP services
* Technical Writing

I am taking Web Server Programming as as part of a master's program in Computer Science. I chose this course in particular because most of the frontend programming I've done was not recent, and I'd like to be current on the most recent frontend technologies.

### And now a lovely image of triangles, which I created using Paint:
